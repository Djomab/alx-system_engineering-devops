# 0x0C. Web server
This project contains tasks for learning about the installation and configuration of a web server (Nginx).

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0\. Transfer a file to your server<br/>_**[0-transfer_file](0-transfer_file)**_ contains a Bash script that uses `ssh` to transfers a file from a client (the local system) to a server.
  + Requirements:
    + Accepts 4 parameters.
      1. The path to the file to be transferred.
      2. The  IP of the server we want to transfer the file to.
      3. The username `scp` connects with.
      4. The path to the SSH private key that `scp` uses.
    + Display `Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY` if less than 3 parameters passed.
    + `scp` must transfer the file to the user home directory `~/`.
    + Strict host key checking must be disabled when using `scp`.

+ [x] 1\. Install nginx web server<br/>_**[1-install_nginx_web_server](1-install_nginx_web_server)**_ contains a Bash script that installs the Nginx web server.
  + Requirements:
    + Install `nginx` on your `web-01` server.
    + Nginx should be listening on port 80.
    + When querying Nginx at its root `/` with a GET request (requesting a page) using `curl`, it must return a page that contains the string `Hello World`.
    + As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself).
    + You can't use `systemctl` for restarting `nginx`.

+ [x] 2\. Setup a domain name<br/>_**[2-setup_a_domain_name](2-setup_a_domain_name)**_ contains the domain name registered with [.tech domains](https://get.tech) for the web server.
  + Requirements:
    + Provide the domain name only (example: `foobar.tech`), no subdomain (example: `www.foobar.tech`).
    + Configure your DNS records with an A entry so that your root domain points to your web-01 IP address **Warning: the propagation of your records can take time (~1-2 hours)**.
    + Go to [your profile](https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/users/my_profile) and enter your domain in the `Project website url` field.

+ [x] 3\. Redirection<br/>_**[3-redirection](3-redirection)**_ contains a Bash script that configures the Nginx server so that `/redirect_me` redirects to another page.
  + Requirements:
    + The redirection must be a "301 Moved Permanently".
    + You answer file should be a Bash script containing commands to automatically configure a Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements.
    + Using what you did with [1-install_nginx_web_server](1-install_nginx_web_server), write [3-redirection](3-redirection) so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task.

+ [x] 4\. Not found page 404<br/>_**[4-not_found_page_404](4-not_found_page_404)**_ contains a Bash script that configures the Nginx server to have a custom 404 page that contains the string `Ceci n'est pas une page`.
  + Requirements:
    + The page must return an HTTP 404 error code.
    + The page must contain the string `Ceci n'est pas une page`.
    + Using what you did with [3-redirection](3-redirection), write [4-not_found_page_404](4-not_found_page_404) so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task.

+ [x] 5\. Install Nginx web server (w/ Puppet)<br/>_**[7-puppet_install_nginx_web_server.pp](7-puppet_install_nginx_web_server.pp)**_ installs and configures an Nginx server using Puppet instead of Bash. It also includes resources in the manifest to perform a 301 redirect when querying /redirect_me.
  + Requirements:
    + Nginx should be listening on port 80.
    + When querying Nginx at its root `/` with a GET request (requesting a page) using `curl`, it must return a page that contains the string `Hello World`.
    + The redirection must be a "301 Moved Permanently".
    + Your answer file should be a Puppet manifest containing commands to automatically configure an Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements.
